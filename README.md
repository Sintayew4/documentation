Welcome to Chainlink developer documentation repository. This repository is the source for developer documentation on [docs.chain.link](https://docs.chain.link/), which is a resource for smart contract developers and node operators building decentralized applications on several networks.

This documentation is open source. If you want to contribute tutorials or improvements, see the [Contributing](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

> [!NOTE]
> The code samples in this documentation are examples for using Chainlink products and services and are provided to help you understand how to
> interact with Chainlink's systems and services so that you can integrate them into your own. These templates are provided
> "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, have not been audited, and may be missing key checks or
> error handling to make the usage of the product more clear. Do not use the example code in a production
> environment without completing your own audits and application of best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs, the
> Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are generated due to
> errors in code.
